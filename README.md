## Course Information

- **Course**: EEE 304 - Digital Electronics Laboratory
- **Department**: Electrical and Electronic Engineering
- **Institution**: Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)
- **Session**: August - December 2023
- **Instructors**: Nafis Sadik (Lecturer, EEE, BUET) and Mrinmoy Kundu (Lecturer, PT, EEE, BUET)

This was my first introduction to Verilog HDL programming, where I implemented various digital circuits and systems.

## Experiments Overview

### Experiment 1-6: Introduction to Verilog and Basic Digital Components

The first few experiments focused on learning the Verilog Hardware Description Language and implementing basic digital components:

### Experiment 7: Full Adders
Implemented 1-bit and 4-bit full adders using both structural and behavioral descriptions in Verilog.
- Designed a 1-bit full adder using basic logic gates
- Created a behavioral model of the 1-bit full adder
- Extended the design to a 4-bit full adder by cascading 1-bit adders

### Experiment 8: Adder-Subtractor
Built a 4-bit adder-subtractor circuit that can perform both addition and subtraction operations based on a control input.
- Used the full adder modules from the previous experiment
- Implemented 2's complement subtraction using XOR gates
- Tested the circuit for various input combinations

### Report Problem 1: 12-Bit Comparator
Designed and implemented a 12-bit comparator that determines whether one binary number is greater than, less than, or equal to another binary number.

### Report Problem 2: Ternary Adder
Developed a ternary adder circuit that handles base-3 number addition.
- Created a binary-encoded truth table
- Derived Boolean expressions using Karnaugh maps
- Implemented the design in Verilog

### Experiment 3: Decoders and Multiplexers
Worked with various decoder and multiplexer configurations:
- Implemented a 5-to-32 decoder using two 4-to-16 decoders
- Designed various multiplexer circuits (8:1, 10:1)
- Created a multiplexer-demultiplexer pair

### Experiment 4: Registers and Counters
Implemented various sequential circuits:
- Designed shift registers with parallel load capability
- Created a frequency divider using binary counters
- Analyzed timing and clock relationships

### Experiment 5: Finite State Machines
Designed and implemented state machines for specific applications:
- Created a sequential turn signal controller with left and right indicators
- Developed a "stomp stomp clap" pattern detector state machine

### Experiment 6: SAP-1 Computer
Worked with a Simple-As-Possible (SAP-1) computer architecture:
- Studied the basic timing states and dataflow
- Implemented the controller module in Verilog
- Tested various operations (LDA, ADD, SUB, OUT, HLT)

## Learning Outcomes

Through these experiments, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Verilog HDL programming
- Digital circuit design principles
- Combinational and sequential circuit implementation
- State machine design
- Computer architecture fundamentals

This repository represents my first steps into digital design using hardware description languages.
